# Development

Contributions are welcome. The repository is [matthiaskoenig/sbml2cellml](https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/sbml2cellml); development happens against the `develop` branch via pull requests.

## Branch model

Two branches are permanent:

- **`develop`** is the default branch and the branch everything is integrated
  into. The documentation on
  [matthiaskoenig.github.io/sbml2cellml](https://matthiaskoenig.github.io/sbml2cellml)
  is published from it.
- **`main`** tracks the latest published release. It is fast-forwarded to the
  released commit by the `sync-main` job of the `CI-CD` workflow after the
  package went to pypi, so `main` and the newest version on pypi always agree.
  Nothing is developed on `main` and nothing is merged into it by hand.

Work happens on short lived branches off `develop`, which GitHub deletes after
the merge. Releases are tagged on `develop`, see [Release](#release).

## Pull requests

Neither branch accepts a direct push, every change goes through a pull request
against `develop`. This includes the maintainer, there is no bypass.

A pull request can only be merged once the four required checks are green:

| check   | workflow      | content                                                             |
| ------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tests` | `ci-cd.yml`   | the test matrix, linux and macos with python 3.13 and 3.14          |
| `ruff`  | `ruff.yml`    | `ruff check` and `ruff format --check`                              |
| `ty`    | `ty.yml`      | `tox r -e ty`                                                       |
| `docs`  | `docs.yml`    | the zensical build including the api reference and the agent files  |

`tests` aggregates the test matrix into a single job, so the name of the
required check stays the same when the matrix changes. On linux the CI
installs the python dev files before uv, because the roadrunner extension
links against libpython.

Further rules of a pull request:

- conversations have to be resolved before the merge
- an approval is dismissed when new commits are pushed
- the history stays linear, i.e., a pull request is merged with squash or
  rebase; merge commits are disabled
- the maintainer is the code owner of the repository (`.github/CODEOWNERS`) and
  is requested for review on every pull request. A pull request of a contributor
  is therefore reviewed and merged by the maintainer, who has the only write
  access. The rulesets themselves do not require an approval: on a personal
  repository a ruleset cannot ask for an approval only from somebody else, and
  requiring one would block the pull requests of the maintainer, who cannot
  approve their own. Once a second person has write access, a ruleset requiring
  an approving review of a code owner can be added

[Auto-merge](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/automatically-merging-a-pull-request)
is enabled for the repository, so a pull request can be queued and is merged as
soon as the checks pass and the required approval is there.

### Repository policies { #repository-policies }

The protection is implemented with
[repository rulesets](https://docs.github.com/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets).
They are part of the repository in `.github/rulesets/` instead of only living in
the web interface, so a change to a policy is reviewed like any other change:

| ruleset                 | applies to | rules                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `develop.json`          | `develop`  | pull request required, the four checks above, resolved conversations, linear history, no force push, no deletion. **No bypass, for anybody.** |
| `main.json`             | `main`     | linear history, no force push, no deletion, no bypass. The fast-forward of the release workflow needs none, only a force push or a merge commit would be rejected |
| `tags.json`             | all tags   | a tag cannot be deleted or moved, so a release tag keeps pointing at what was released                                                       |

Changing a policy means changing the json and applying it:

```bash
.github/rulesets/apply.sh
```

The script is idempotent: it updates the rulesets which exist and creates the
missing ones. It also sets the merge settings of the repository, i.e.,
auto-merge, delete branch on merge, and squash and rebase as the only merge
methods, and it allows `develop` to deploy to the `github-pages` environment:
enabling GitHub Pages creates that environment with a deployment policy for the
default branch of that moment only, which rejects the deployments of the
documentation workflow from `develop`. It needs the
[github cli](https://cli.github.com) authenticated as a user with admin
permission on the repository.

## Setup development environment

Development needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and a checkout of the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthiaskoenig/sbml2cellml.git
cd sbml2cellml
```

A single sync creates the virtual environment in `.venv`, installs `sbml2cellml` into it in editable mode and adds the complete tooling:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

The `dev` extra contains everything used below, i.e., pytest, ruff, ty, tox, pre-commit, zensical and bump-my-version, together with the `simulate` extra, libopencor and libroadrunner for the roundtrip tests. libopencor is not on PyPI; `[tool.uv.index]` in `pyproject.toml` points uv at the wheels of its GitHub release, so `uv sync` installs it like any other dependency (pip users see [Installation](installation.md#simulators)). The python version is taken from `.python-version` (3.14, the newest supported version; 3.13 is supported as well).

The tools are then run either with `uv run <command>`, which uses the environment without activating it, or from the activated environment:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate        # Linux and macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

The commands in this document are written without the `uv run` prefix; prepend it if the environment is not activated.

The last step installs the git hook:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install          # install the hook, once per checkout
uv run pre-commit run --all-files  # check the current state of the repository
```

From now on every commit is checked with ruff (lint and format) and ty, i.e., the same checks that run in continuous integration. On a commit only the changed files are looked at, `--all-files` checks the whole repository and is what a newly added hook should be tried with.

## Testing

The tests are written with pytest, tox runs them against the supported python versions.

The tox environments are `py3.13`, `py3.14` and `ty` (see `envlist` in `tox.ini`); a test environment is run with
```bash
tox r -e py3.14
```
and all environments, in parallel, with
```bash
tox run-parallel
```

The tox environments are created from `uv.lock` by tox-uv (`runner = uv-venv-lock-runner` in `tox.ini`), which is what makes the libopencor index available to them.

This needs the interpreters to be available, which uv installs with `uv python install 3.13 3.14`. Continuous integration runs the same environments as `uvx --with tox-uv tox -e py3.13` and `-e py3.14`.

To run the tests directly against the development environment use

```bash
pytest                                                       # the full suite
pytest tests/test_cellml.py                                  # a single module
pytest tests/test_cellml.py::test_read_model                 # a single test
```

The simulation tests and the examples need libopencor and are skipped without it; with `uv sync --extra dev` it is installed.

The roundtrip tests (`tests/test_roundtrip.py`) need roadrunner and are skipped without it. roadrunner and libopencor bundle different LLVM versions and crash once both have JIT-compiled in one process, so roadrunner runs in a subprocess (`tests/simulators.py`); the same rule shapes the process model of the [SBML test suite](#sbml-test-suite) harness.

## Linting and formatting

Linting and formatting use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/):

```bash
ruff check     # lint
ruff format    # format
```

## Type checking

Type checking is performed with [ty](https://docs.astral.sh/ty/):

```bash
tox r -e ty
```
Or directly in the working tree:
```bash
uvx ty check
```

The configuration lives in `[tool.ty]` in `pyproject.toml`. Warnings are treated as errors, so the codebase is kept free of diagnostics. Suppress an unavoidable diagnostic with a rule specific `# ty: ignore[rule-name]` rather than a blanket comment.

## Documentation

The documentation is built with [Zensical](https://zensical.org/), the static site generator of the Material for MkDocs authors. The sources are markdown files in `docs/`, the site is configured in `zensical.toml` in the repository root. Nothing rendered is committed: the site is built by the `documentation` workflow on every push and published to [matthiaskoenig.github.io/sbml2cellml](https://matthiaskoenig.github.io/sbml2cellml) from the `develop` branch. The workflow builds with `--strict`, so a warning such as a broken link fails the `docs` check.

Build the site into `site/`:

```bash
uv run zensical build --clean
```

For writing, the preview rebuilds on save:

```bash
uv run zensical serve
```

The API reference is rendered from the docstrings by [mkdocstrings](https://mkdocstrings.github.io/); a page in `docs/api/` only contains the module directive:

```markdown
# cellml

::: sbml2cellml.cellml
```

Docstrings are therefore the place to document functions and classes, the markdown files provide the narrative around them. Adding a module to the reference means adding such a page and an entry to `nav` in `zensical.toml`.

### Files for agents { #files-for-agents }

Agents and language models read markdown, not rendered html. `scripts/llms_txt.py` writes the files of the [llms.txt convention](https://llmstxt.org/) into the built site, i.e., [llms.txt](https://matthiaskoenig.github.io/sbml2cellml/llms.txt) as an annotated index of all pages, [llms-full.txt](https://matthiaskoenig.github.io/sbml2cellml/llms-full.txt) with the complete documentation in a single file, and the markdown of every page next to its html (`/conversion-issues.md` for `/conversion-issues/`). The markdown of the API reference is generated from the docstrings with `inspect`, since the pages themselves only contain the mkdocstrings directive.

```bash
uv run zensical build --clean
uv run python scripts/llms_txt.py
```

The `documentation` workflow runs both steps, so the files are regenerated with every push. `docs/robots.txt` points crawlers at the sitemap and at these files. Zensical will provide agent context files itself at some point, then this script can go.

## Repository setup { #repository-setup }

The one-time setup of the GitHub repository, for the record:

1. `develop` is created from `main` and made the default branch: `gh repo edit matthiaskoenig/sbml2cellml --default-branch develop`
2. the GitHub Pages source is set to GitHub Actions: `gh api -X POST repos/matthiaskoenig/sbml2cellml/pages -f build_type=workflow`
3. the merge settings, the rulesets and the deployment branch of the documentation are applied: `.github/rulesets/apply.sh`
4. the PyPI trusted publisher is registered on [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/) for the project `sbml2cellml`, owner `matthiaskoenig`, repository `sbml2cellml`, workflow `ci-cd.yml`, environment `pypi` (as a pending publisher before the first release)
5. the repository is enabled in the [Zenodo GitHub integration](https://zenodo.org/account/settings/github/), so that a GitHub release is archived with a DOI

## SBML test suite { #sbml-test-suite }

`sbml2cellml.testsuite` runs the [SBML test suite](https://github.com/sbmlteam/sbml-test-suite) through both converters and both simulators, so that every conversion gap is measured against a real corpus instead of a handful of examples. Each runnable case goes through five stages: the original SBML is simulated with roadrunner (`reference`), converted to CellML (`sbml2cellml`), the CellML is simulated with libopencor (`libopencor`), converted back to SBML (`cellml2sbml`) and the roundtrip SBML is simulated again with roadrunner (`roundtrip`); every simulation is compared with the expected results of the case using its tolerances. Cases with an SBML package the converters do not support, without a level 3 version 2 file or of a test type other than `TimeCourse` are skipped.

```bash
uv run sbml2cellml-testsuite run
```

downloads the suite into `~/.cache/sbml2cellml` on first use (`SBML2CELLML_CACHE` overrides the cache root), runs the pipeline and writes `testsuite/results.json`, `docs/testsuite.md` and its bar diagram `docs/images/testsuite.svg` (`testsuite_dark.svg` for dark backgrounds, also shown in `README.md`). `--cases 00001,00002` restricts the run to a subset of case ids and `--suite-dir` points at a local copy of the `semantic/` directory instead of downloading. The comparison uses tight solver tolerances (`1e-9` relative, `1e-12` absolute, passed to every roadrunner and libopencor call) so it measures the conversion rather than the default integrator tolerances, an amendment to the original harness design.

`testsuite/results.json`, `docs/testsuite.md` and the figures `docs/images/testsuite*.svg` are generated and committed. `tests/test_testsuite_full.py` (enabled with `SBML2CELLML_TESTSUITE=1`, run with `tox r -e testsuite` and in the linux CI job) reruns the full suite and fails if any case regresses against the committed results or if the rendered report no longer matches `docs/testsuite.md`. To accept an improvement, rerun `uv run sbml2cellml-testsuite run` and commit the updated `testsuite/results.json`, `docs/testsuite.md` and figures together in the same pull request. `uv run sbml2cellml-testsuite report` rerenders the report and the figures from the committed results, e.g., after a change of the report itself.

roadrunner and libopencor bundle different LLVM versions and crash once both have JIT-compiled in one process (see [Testing](#testing)); the harness therefore runs each simulator in its own worker process (`sbml2cellml.testsuite.worker`) for the whole run, instead of starting a subprocess per call.

## Release

A release is made from `develop`. Since `develop` only accepts pull requests,
the release is prepared on a branch and tagged once that pull request is merged:

1. branch off `develop`: `git switch -c release/x.y.z develop`
2. write the release notes for the version in `docs/release-notes/x.y.z.md` and add the page to the `Release notes` section of `nav` in `zensical.toml` and to the overview `docs/release-notes/index.md`, newest first. The notes are part of the [documentation](release-notes/index.md) and the body of the GitHub release; `tests/test_package.py` fails when the current version has no notes or a page is missing in the navigation or the overview
3. make sure everything passes: `tox run-parallel`, `ruff check`, `tox r -e ty`
4. check the version bump: `uvx bump-my-version bump [major|minor|patch] --dry-run -vv`
5. bump the version: `uvx bump-my-version bump [major|minor|patch]`, which updates `src/sbml2cellml/__init__.py` and `CITATION.cff` and commits. It does not create the tag; a squash or rebase merge would rewrite the commit and leave the tag behind on a commit which is not part of `develop`
6. push the branch, open the pull request against `develop` and merge it once the checks are green
7. tag the merged commit on `develop` and push the tag:

    ```bash
    git switch develop
    git pull
    git tag x.y.z
    git push origin x.y.z
    ```

    This starts the `CI-CD` workflow, which runs the test matrix, publishes to
    [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/sbml2cellml/), creates the GitHub release
    from `docs/release-notes/x.y.z.md` and fast-forwards `main` to the tagged commit.
    Check the version before pushing, a tag cannot be moved or deleted
    afterwards.

8. test the installation from pypi in a fresh environment:

    ```bash
    uv venv --python 3.14
    uv pip install sbml2cellml
    ```

9. once Zenodo has archived the release, update the citation information, i.e., `date-released` in `CITATION.cff` and the version, date and version DOI of the release in the citation of `README.md` and `docs/index.md`. `bump-my-version` only updates the version, not the date and the DOI, which are only known after the release. These changes go in through a pull request like everything else
